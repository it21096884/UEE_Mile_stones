   Your group has selected a business idea and investigated it. Now you are going to identify
      different user groups/stakeholders for the selected business idea.
   You must identify the target users by referring to the available resources and find out more

          o Service Blueprint(s) – 01 Service Blueprint from a group
 Present your user models to your supervisor and get feedback during the lab session
 Update your group report including Milestone 01.

Milestone 2: Plan and conduct user research
     Plan and conduct user research ( 04 users) and understand their experiences and
    motivations
     You must research target users for each of your functionalities

     Present your problem statement to your supervisor and get feedback during the lab session.
     Update your group report including Milestone 03.
    
Milestone 4: Sketching & Wireframes

  problem statement you’ve defined in Milestone 3.

   Update your group report including Milestone 04.

  Milestone 5: Prototype
     This is an experimental phase and Aim is to identify the best possible solution for each of
    the problems identified.
     Produce several inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the proposed solution(s)
     By the end of this stage, the design team will have a better idea of the constraints inherent
    to the product and the problems that present a clearer view of how real users would
    behave, think, and feel when interacting with the end product.
     Present your prototype(s) to your supervisor and get feedback during the lab session.
     Update your group report including Milestone 05.
    
Milestone 6: User Feedback for your Prototype
     Designers/evaluators rigorously test the complete product using the best solutions
    identified during the prototyping phase.
     The results generated during the testing phase are often used to redefine one or more
    problems and inform the understanding of the users.
     Present the collected User Feedback to your supervisor and discuss it during the lab session.
     Update your group report including Milestone 06.
    
Milestone 7: Implementation
   Implement your application in collaboration on GitHub (this pertains to your personal
